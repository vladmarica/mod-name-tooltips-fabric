# Mod Name Tooltips [Fabric] 

A [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod for Minecraft that simply adds mod names to item tooltips.

Inspired by [mezz's similar mod](https://github.com/mezz/ModNameTooltip) for Forge. I couldn't find an equivalent for Fabric, so I made my own.

This is a client-side mod. The server doesn't need to have it installed.
